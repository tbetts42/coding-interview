# <a name="instructions"></a>Java interview question setup

The `src` directory contains starter code for your upcoming coding interview.
Prior to your interview, please take some time to ensure you can edit the files and compile the
application.

During the coding interview you will edit the attached solution files in an IDE while sharing your
screen.

The code targets Java 11. You can use any IDE or code editor you prefer! Some recommendations are IntelliJ, Eclipse, VSCode, or Notepad++.

If you are unable to use an IDE during the interview, please reach out to the recruiter to discuss options. Your interviewers should be able
to accommodate a browser-based option using [https://vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev). Using vscode.dev requires signing in with either a GitHub
or Microsoft account.
